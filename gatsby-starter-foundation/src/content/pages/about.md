When I was younger, all of my friends were obsessed with Harry Styles. While he did make an impact on millions, my fascination lied with the people walking the streets of downtown Toronto, holding their briefcases, towering over me as I finished my hotdog. My 9-year-old self thought those people were untouchable. Less of a mirage now, I consider these people to be influential pillars of the STEM industry who drive innovation forward.
 
My name is Angel Li, and I am currently a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I am proficient in C, Python, and Javascript, with experience in mobile and web development.
 
I decided to pursue a career in the technology industry so that I could not only collaborate with, but be one of the people who 10 years ago, were just a figment of my imagination.
