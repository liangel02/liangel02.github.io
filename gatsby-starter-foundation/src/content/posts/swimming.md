My summer of 2019 was spent at Life Time Fitness as a lifeguard and swim instructor. I would spend up to 20 hours lifeguarding the 2 indoor pools, and of course, the outdoor pool that Life Time is known for. The other 9 hours of my weekly shifts were spent instructing children from the ages of 1-13, teaching them how to swim.
 
I have been working at Life Time for over a year now, and while I've made many memories and met so many incredible people, that summer stands out in my mind. Maybe it is due to the fact that I still have a tan on my back to remind me, but I like to think that the reason I remember that summer the most is because those 3 months is when it finally hit me.
 
To most people, a part time job in high school is a way to make extra money, but to me, swimming was a lifestyle.
 
My parents put me in swimming lessons ever since the age of three. I took lessons with the city until the age of 10 before I decided to swim competitively.
 
For 3 years, the sound of my alarm would rip me away from my sleep at 4:46 AM. Twice a week, I woke up before the sun to attend swim practice, and the other three times, I came home in the dark. When I first started attending practice, I hated it. I was exhausted after the first 20 minutes; every breath I took I held onto. However, over time, I grew to love the pain. The smell of chlorine was my adrenaline, the buzz at every meet was my addiction. I saw my teammates five times a week for two hours at a time; arguably a little too much. But it was the amount of time we spent together that helped to cultivate an incredible bond. My swim community was a second family, a place where I felt I belonged.
 
My involvement in the Mississauga Aquatic Club taught me the importance of perseverance and commitment. Through putting in literal blood, sweat, and tears into a sport showed me the effort hidden behind every success story. Beating my best times at meets made throwing up after practice worth it. My hours of hard work paid off when I placed 7th twice at provincial meets. I will always remember the feeling of accomplishment, but I will remember the feeling of pain even more.
 
At the age of 14, I applied to be a Junior Instructor with the City of Mississauga in the Aquatics department. I wanted to be back in lessons with the city, but this time, viewing the process from a different perspective. As Junior Instructor, I assisted instructors in teaching levels that spanned from parent and toddler lessons to the Lifesaving Society courses. Volunteering up to three times a week for four hours at a time, I was a familiar face to both children and parents. I thought of different drills and exercises to implement in the older levels to perfect technique and different games and songs to incorporate in the younger levels to engage swimmers. I helped to demonstrate and teach skills in a friendly manner. Whenever I was not with a class, I was always cleaning up equipment or shadowing student evaluations. After only a month, I was given the responsibility of teaching a lesson by myself.
 
While volunteering, I continued on with the Lifesaving Society program and worked towards my NLS. The courses were always rigorous, with First Aid training as well as components to test physical stamina. One test that stood out to me was the brick. 20 pounds. Retrieve from the bottom of the pool. Swim 10m. My peers found it to be the easiest exercise. But with the brick being a little over 1/4 of my body weight, I got acquainted to the feeling of drowning. Even though my course started in late September, I had been going to the pool since July to practice retreiving that brick. The first time I tried, I dropped the brick after breaking the surface of the water. But every single week that I went, I improved slightly because I refused to let external circumnstances dictate what I was able to accomplish. And sure enough, I passed that physical on the first attempt.
 
The lessons I learned can be applied in every aspect of life. As much as it is important to have the skills, the ability to chase ambition and refuse defeat is what determines success. My experience with swimming has helped me develop my perserverance and dedication to not only the sport, but everything else that I set my mind out to do.
 
Now, as a lifeguard and swim instructor/coach, I am able to share my passion for swimming with young individuals to hopefully inspire them to challenge themselves and reach their potentials.
