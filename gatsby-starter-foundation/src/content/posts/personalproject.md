Over the course of two months, I completed a Parkinson’s diagnosis iOS application. Utilizing Python’s machine learning libraries and XGBoost, the app is able to train/test the original data for classification, increasing the speed and accuracy of the diagnosis process. Using Swift, I built an interactive UI that passes input data to a web server created using Django which returns a label. I faced my first obstacle when sending user data from the frontend to backend. I watched videos discussing the topic and learned about the components of a mobile application, working towards a high level understanding of web servers. After around a month, I successfully connected the two components. My desire to throw my laptop out the window at times didn’t take away from my passion; in fact, the satisfaction and pride that I gained from overcoming those challenges only furthered my interest. The time I dedicated to this project deepened my understanding of ML and app development. My mentality towards challenge developed into one that is inspired by growth rather than quitting. This project is continuous, and I am still looking for ways to optimize my program and improve end user experience.
