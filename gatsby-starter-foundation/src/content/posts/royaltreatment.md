I still remember how I felt when I wrote my AP entrance exam. Surrounded by 500 other students, I was quite literally shaking from the nerves as I waited to be directed to my room. Although most of the day was a blur, all of my snapshots of the experience include a Royal Treatment member. Those individuals helped me feel comfortable and confident and I decided I wanted to do the same for others.
 
Royal Treatment is an organization at my school that liaises between administration, the school board, and the broader community. I was selected as a crew member my grade 10 year and over the next two years, I assisted during Parent’s Night, AP testing, and various other events. These events often cater towards 2000 people; this seems like a recipe for disaster, and it would be were it not for the diligent planning by the Royal Treatment team.
 
In my grade 11 year, I spearheaded our school’s first Friday Night Lights where our senior boys soccer team played a game against another school’s team during a night in May. Behind the scenes, my team and I liaised with the other school to book the field, determined how many people needed to be helping, how much food to order, and planned out the logistics of an event of 1000 attendees. The careful planning of our team allowed for the event to run smoothly. Raising $5000 for our school’s athletic council, FNL provided a fun experience for students from both schools to spend time with friends while showing school spirit.
 
As a senior, I was chosen as vice president. Other than the responsibilities of a crew member, my roles included liaising between teachers and administration as well as delegating tasks to our 35 crew members. Within council, I constantly mentor crew members, fostering leadership and confidence. Regularly meeting with administration has helped me appreciate the efforts involved and allowed me to develop closer relationships with staff. At events, I am the first to resolve a situation, whether that be assisting with a language barrier or settling a conflict. During this year’s Parent’s Night, we had frustrated parents engaging in heated arguments near interview spaces. I had to make quick decisions to diffuse the situation, whether that be scheduling makeup interviews or redirecting them to administration. These stressful situations have taught me how to navigate complex emotions and helped me cultivate meaningful relationships with the members of my community.
 
Throughout my years in Royal Treatment, I have made newcomers, parents, and board members feel more welcome, ultimately promoting a more inclusive environment. The positivity I once experienced from the Royal Treatment members five years ago still resonates with me and constantly motivates me to continue to be at the forefront of my community.
