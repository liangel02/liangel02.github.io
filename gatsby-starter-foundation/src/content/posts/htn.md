When Chamath Palihapitiya shared his experiences from attending Waterloo to founding his multibillion-dollar company during Hack the North's opening ceremonies, he said something so simple that continues to resonate with me: "Find the thing that upsets you and go fix it.‚Äù
 
Hack the North is Canada's largest international 36hour Hackathon hosted at the University of Waterloo. I applied in my grade 11 year with little to no knowledge of technology (I knew what an array was and I was proud of myself for that). Surprisingly, I was accepted, and that experience marked the beginning of my passion for technology.
 
With 1500 competitors participating from around the world, I was able to use this experience to network and acquire knowledge on concepts ranging from neural networks to deep learning. My team and I created a working webpage that uses artificial intelligence to provide feedback on rehearsals.
 
Throughout the 3 days, I sought out mentorships from influential industry representatives and professors. I liaised with the judges and other experienced participants, presenting my prototype to them as well as representatives from Facebook.
 
My Hack the North experience is irreplaceable and allowed me to develop a deeper appreciation for technology, cultivating passion. Following the hackathon, I began to further develop my prototype and start new side projects to further my skills.
 
Almost 2 years later, I still remember sitting on the steps of E5 at midnight surrounded by the infamous geese of Waterloo. I knew that the energy I had experienced over that weekend, along with the people I met and the memories I created, would continue to stay with me as I started my career in computer science.
