As a child, all of my friends were obsessed with Harry Styles. While he did make an impact on millions, my fascination lied with the powerful women walking the streets of downtown Toronto, holding their coffees, towering over me as I finished my hotdog. My 9-year-old self thought those women were untouchable. But as I get older, I realize that they were far from it. As influential pillars of the STEM industry, they had to work twice as hard as their male counterparts to achieve success. I wanted to join WiCS so that I could bring awareness to the prevalent gender stereotypes in STEM industries so that 10 years from now, any young girl believing that these women are untouchable would be right.

As the systems administrator for UWaterloo's Women in Computer Science, I am responsible for maintaining and updating the organization's website using React. My duties as first year representative include ensuring that the voices and opinions of all first years at UW are heard.

As one of the youngest executives, I recently assisted in the planning and execution process of a Women in Tech panel held across the university.
