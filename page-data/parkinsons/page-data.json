Utilizing Python’s machine learning libraries and XGBoost, the app is able to train/test the original data for classification, increasing the speed and accuracy of the diagnosis process. Using Swift, I built an interactive UI that passes input data to a web server created using Django which returns a label. I faced my first obstacle when sending user data from the frontend to backend. I watched videos discussing the topic and learned about the components of a mobile application, working towards a high level understanding of web servers.
