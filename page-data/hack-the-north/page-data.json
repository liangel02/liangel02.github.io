I applied in my grade 11 year with little to no knowledge of technology (I knew what an array was and I was proud of myself for that). Surprisingly, I was accepted, and that experience marked the beginning of my passion for technology.</p>\n<p>With 1500 competitors participating from around the world, I was able to use this experience to network and acquire knowledge on concepts ranging from neural networks to deep learning. My team and I created a working webpage that uses artificial intelligence to provide feedback on rehearsals.</p>\n<p>Throughout the 3 days, I sought out mentorships from influential industry representatives and professors. I liaised with the judges and other experienced participants, presenting my prototype to them as well as representatives from Facebook.</p>\n<p>My Hack the North experience is irreplaceable and allowed me to develop a deeper appreciation for technology, cultivating passion. Following the hackathon, I began to further develop my prototype and start new side projects to further my skills.</p>\n<p>Almost 2 years later, I still remember sitting on the steps of E5 at midnight surrounded by the infamous geese of Waterloo. I knew that the energy I had experienced over that weekend, along with the people I met and the memories I created, would continue to stay with me as I started my career in computer science.</p>","excerpt":"When Chamath Palihapitiya shared his experiences from attending Waterloo to founding his multibillion-dollar company during Hack the North's opening…","frontmatter":{"date":"May 13, 2020","slug":"hack-the-north","title":"Hack the North","description":"My first hackathon","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.573529411764706,"src":"/static/40ab18842258ee720db97504c0ac09cb/309c0/htn.png","srcSet":"/static/40ab18842258ee720db97504c0ac09cb/221b3/htn.png 350w,\n/static/40ab18842258ee720db97504c0ac09cb/a632b/htn.png 700w,\n/static/40ab18842258ee720db97504c0ac09cb/309c0/htn.png 820w","sizes":"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px","maxHeight":318,"maxWidth":820},"sizes":{"src":"/static/40ab18842258ee720db97504c0ac09cb/ee604/htn.png"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3faded72-993b-545b-a669-8d9c051cd54a","previous":{"id":"1066d7f4-4ff8-577f-86cb-a72211b98e51","frontmatter":{"slug":"royaltreatment","template":"blog-post","title":"Royal Treatment"}},"next":{"id":"d4cadc94-9e3d-55d3-b079-b8fc6d495a71","frontmatter":{"slug":"swimming","template":"blog-post","title":"Swimming - Not Just a Sport"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["228695001","4267595483"]}
