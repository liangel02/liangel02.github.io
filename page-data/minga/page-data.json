Role-playing a 13-year-old Kenyan girl, the feeling of injustice crushed me - a glimpse into what billions of people endure every day. Since that day, my motivations have consistently stemmed from wanting to increase the number of people that step forward.</p>\n<p>In grade 9, I applied for MINGA, my school’s largest humanitarian club in partnership with WE. As one of the 30 selected ambassadors from approximately 300 applicants, my responsibilities included assisting with monthly school wide events to raise awareness and funds for various humanitarian issues. Eager to contribute more, I decided to campaign for grade representative, and after being elected, I was responsible for updating everyone on upcoming events through social media and leading interactive activities. Motivated by my success as a leader and encouraged by the executives at the time, I decided to apply for an executive position in May.</p>\n<p>The following year, as the only grade 10 executive, I used the opportunity to understand the process of planning and executing large events. I was able to take a lead role in idea generation and event execution, design hoodies, and oversee grade representative activities. Wanting to improve the outreach of our promotions, I implemented unconventional marketing tactics; we incorporated homeroom visits and interactive social media posts. Following this change, our next event raised over $1000, a 30% increase from the year before.</p>\n<p>As Director of Student Ambassadors during my senior years, I liaise between the executive team and ambassadors, increasing meeting turnout by 10%. I provide updated information on the planning process of events, host meetings, lead empowering humanitarian activities, and run various social media accounts. I oversaw the recruitment process of ambassadors, resulting in an 80% annual retention rate. </p>\n<p>Over the past four years, MINGA has raised a total of $22 000 that was donated towards a plethora of organizations, including our local food bank, Salvation Army, and Doctors Without Borders. This number represents milestones achieved throughout the years, impacting hundreds of people both in my community and around the globe. I hope that my efforts have left behind a legacy at my school, motivating others to step into the shoes of the less fortunate so that we can increase the number of people who step forward from the line.</p>","excerpt":"“Step forward from the line if you have access to clean drinking water.” Those words echoed in my mind as I stayed where I was, watching others move…","frontmatter":{"date":"May 23, 2020","slug":"minga","title":"MINGA","description":"Largest schoolwide humanitarian club","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":2.573529411764706,"src":"/static/66bb9746f8d293b63f081878bcc4df78/db139/minga.jpg","srcSet":"/static/66bb9746f8d293b63f081878bcc4df78/3ad57/minga.jpg 350w,\n/static/66bb9746f8d293b63f081878bcc4df78/79ba3/minga.jpg 700w,\n/static/66bb9746f8d293b63f081878bcc4df78/db139/minga.jpg 960w","sizes":"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px","maxHeight":372,"maxWidth":960},"sizes":{"src":"/static/66bb9746f8d293b63f081878bcc4df78/14b42/minga.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ce3fe710-83e2-523b-a965-d1e8589aaa8a","previous":{"id":"d4cadc94-9e3d-55d3-b079-b8fc6d495a71","frontmatter":{"slug":"swimming","template":"blog-post","title":"Swimming - Not Just a Sport"}},"next":{"id":"17419694-34dd-5ccd-8ddb-70d20ead303e","frontmatter":{"slug":"/contact","template":"contact-page","title":"Get in touch"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["228695001","4267595483"]}
